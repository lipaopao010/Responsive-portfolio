#Responsive Portfolio#

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, we will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

In this assignment, I am asked to use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate my portfolio. 

So I create the following pages: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
And I use Bootstrap to recreate the portfolio site with the following items:
a navbar,a responsive layout and responsive images.

The grid system is used for the layout of the main contents.But i did use media queries to create some extra margin in bigger screens.

From this project, I successfully made an responsive portfolio using Bootstrap.
